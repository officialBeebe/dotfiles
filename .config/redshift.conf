; Redshift Configuration
; =========================
;
; Adjusts color temperature and brightness based on time of day or solar position.
; This version uses solar elevation thresholds for automatic day/night detection.

; --- Color Temperature (Kelvin) ---
temp-day=5500
temp-night=3000

; --- Fade and Transition Control ---
; fade=1   -> smooth fade when starting/stopping
; transition=1 -> gradual temperature change during dawn/dusk
fade=1
transition=1

; --- Solar Elevation Thresholds ---
; When the sun is above elevation-high, it's considered daytime.
; When it's below elevation-low, it's considered night.
; Typical values: high=3°, low=-6° (civil twilight)
elevation-high=3
elevation-low=-6

; --- Manual Dawn/Dusk Times (optional, commented out) ---
; Uncomment these lines to override solar elevation and use manual times.
; Works in Redshift ≥ 1.12.  Earlier versions will ignore or error.
; dawn-time=08:00-09:00
; dusk-time=18:30-19:30

; --- Brightness Settings ---
brightness-day=1.0
brightness-night=0.8

; --- Gamma Settings ---
; Single float (applies to all RGB channels) or colon-separated triple (R:G:B)
gamma-day=1.0
gamma-night=1.0

; --- Location Provider ---
; Options: 'manual', 'geoclue2'
location-provider=manual

; --- Adjustment Method ---
; Options: 'randr', 'vidmode', 'wayland'
; Use 'randr' for X11, 'wayland' for modern GNOME/KDE sessions.
